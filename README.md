# Encryptor-dectryptor
Super simple python GUI file encryptor/decryptor


### Usage:
To **encrypt** a file, press "Encrypt" to open the file explorer and choose the file you want to encrypt. When the file is chosen, an encrypted copy is placed in the root directory. The original file is not altered.

To **decrypt**, using the decrypt button will create a decrypted version of the file in the root directory.

The **key** file holds the key, and will be updated (overwritten) when the user either generates a new key or inserts a new key into the key field. Make a backup of this file to save the key for later.
